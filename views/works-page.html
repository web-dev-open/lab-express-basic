          In 2007, Downey was cast as the title character in the film Iron
          Man,[78] with director Jon Favreau explaining the choice by stating:
          "Downey wasn't the most obvious choice, but he understood what makes
          the character tick. He found a lot of his own life experience in 'Tony
          Stark'."Favreau insisted on having Downey as he repeatedly
          claimed that Downey would be to Iron Man what Johnny Depp is to the
          Pirates of the Caribbean series: a lead actor who could both elevate
          the quality of the film and increase the public's interest in
          it.For the role, Downey had to gain more than 20
          pounds (9 kilograms) of muscle in five months to look like he "had the
          power to forge iron". Iron Man was released worldwide between
          April 30 and May 3, 2008, grossing over $585 million worldwide and
          receiving rave reviews which cited Downey's performance as a highlight
          of the film. By October 2008, Downey had agreed to star in
          two Iron Man sequels, as part of the Iron Man franchise, as well as
          The Avengers, featuring the superhero team that Stark joins, based on
          Marvel's comic book series The Avengers.He first reprised the
          role in a small appearance as Iron Man's alter ego Tony Stark in the
          2008 film The Incredible Hulk, as a part of Marvel Studios' depicting
          the same Marvel Universe on film by providing continuity among the
          movies.
