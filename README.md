# Express basic website

  

## Introduction

  

Pick a person that you admire and build a website that shares some basic information about them. They can be a writer, a musician, a celebrity, or someone you know personally.

  

You should use `express` to create your app, build the routing logic with the built-in app routing methods, and serve static content for every request.

  

## Requirements

  

- Fork this repo

- Clone this repo

  

## Submission

  

- Upon completion, run the following commands:

  

```bash

git add .

git commit -m "Solved Lab"

git push origin master

```

  

- Create Pull Request so we can check up your work.

  

## Instructions

  

**Your Website should have (at least) 3 pages:**

  

1. A **Home** page, that welcomes the visitor and links to the other pages on the website.

2. An **About** page, that shares some basic information about the person.

3. A **Works** page, where you showcase some of the work of the person you chose.

4. Bonus: A **Photo Gallery** page, displaying some pictures of the person/their work.

  

You should go through the following steps:

  

1. Run `npm init -y` to create a package.json file.

2. Run `npm install express` to install the Express package.

3. Create a `views/` directory that will hold your `.html` files.

4. Create a `public/` directory that will hold other static files, such as your CSS stylesheets, scripts and images.

5. Build your Express app in `app.js`.

6. Polish your HTML, stylesheets and scripts.

  

Happy coding! ðŸ’™
